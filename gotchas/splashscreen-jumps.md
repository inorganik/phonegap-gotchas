## Splash screen jumps off the screen just before app loads.

##### PROBLEM

On launch, the splashscreen changes size and jumps off the screen at the last second before the app loads.


##### SOLUTION

If you have the splashscreen plugin installed in your project, it could cause this behavior. Simply remove the splashcreen plugin, you will still be able to fade out the splashscreen without it installed.
